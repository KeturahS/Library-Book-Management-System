#Library Book Management System

This project is a C# application designed to manage a library's book collection, featuring capabilities for sorting books by publication year and calculating the average publication year.

During the development of this program, several key C# concepts were explored:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Classes were created to represent books and manage attributes such as title, author, ISBN, and publication year.

Data Structures: Lists were utilized to handle collections of books, with sorting algorithms implemented for efficient organization.

Unit Testing: MSTest was applied to develop tests that ensure the correctness of sorting and average calculation functionalities, reinforcing the importance of reliable code.

This project serves as a hands-on learning experience in software development, contributing to the improvement of coding skills while building a practical application.

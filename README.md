##Library Book Management System

This project is a C# application aimed at managing a library's book collection. It provides features for sorting books by publication year and calculating the average publication year.

As I built this program, I deepened my understanding of key C# concepts, including:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): I created classes to represent books and manage their attributes, such as title, author, ISBN, and publication year.

Data Structures: I utilized lists to handle collections of books and implemented sorting algorithms to organize them efficiently.

Unit Testing: I applied MSTest to develop tests that ensure the correctness of sorting and average calculation functionalities. This reinforced the importance of writing reliable code.

The project serves as a hands-on learning experience in software development, helping me to improve my coding skills while building a practical application.
